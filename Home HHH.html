The 'Handy Hurley Hanger' started as an idea from the Ballynoe National School 5th and 6th class <br>
as part of the <a href = "https://www.juniorentrepreneur.ie"> Junior Entrepenuer Programme. </a> <br> <br> <br>

The Junior Entrepreneur Programme (JEP) Is a programme aimed at schools in Ireland <br>
trying to promote entrepreneurship among children in Ireland. Two years ago, our school took <br>
part in the Junior Entrepreneur Programme with 'Magic Mugs', a mug with the club/county crest on it. <br>
We got to go to the JEP Exhibition in the RDS in Dublin. This year, we are taking part in the JEP again, this time <br>
with the 'Handy Hurley Hangers', a locally sourced, durable and reasonably priced wooden stand to <br>
hold your hurleys!
